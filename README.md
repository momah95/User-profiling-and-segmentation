# User-profiling-and-segmentation
User profiling refers to creating detailed profiles that represent the behaviours and preferences of users, and segmentation divides the user base into distinct groups with common characteristics, making it easier to target specific segments with personalized marketing, products, or services.
This python analysis project is based on user profiling and segmentation for an advertisement campaign.
